## How to install

Install **[nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)**

You need to have `bower` and `grunt-cli` installed prior to use this boilerplate.
They should be installed globally using `-g` flag.

```js
$ npm install -g bower
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Then you just need to run these commands:
```js
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

## How to use

```js
$ grunt serve
```
